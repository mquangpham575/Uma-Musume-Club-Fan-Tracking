# **📄 Uma Club Tracking — Chronogenesis Exporter **

This project fetches **club friend history data** from [ChronoGenesis](https://chronogenesis.net/)  
and automatically exports it into a **formatted Google Spreadsheet** — complete with borders, totals, averages, and conditional formatting.

**Preview**

For the **Endless** community, place your `credentials.json` file in the same folder, then use the `.exe` from **[Releases](../../releases)** — no further setup needed.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**
2. Extract the folder anywhere on your computer
3. Follow this video tutorial to create your Google API credentials:
   ▶️ https://youtu.be/zCEJurLGFRk

- Watch from 1:59 → 6:50 to generate your Service Account key
- Then rename the file to credentials.json and place it in the same folder as main.py  
  Make sure to share your target Google Sheet with the service account’s client_email (Editor access).

4. Open `globals.py` and edit these values if needed:

```
SHEET_ID = "1O09PM-hYo-H05kWWqMg71GelEpfaGrePQWzdDCKOqyU"

CLUBS = {
"1": {"title": "EndGame", "URL": "https://chronogenesis.net/club_profile?circle_id=endgame", "THRESHOLD": 1800000},
...
}
```

```

  - 🔴 **Red** → value below threshold
  - ⚪ **Grey** → blank cell
- `Member_Name` column auto-sized (fits filter icon)

## 🪶 Notes

- If you want to change your output Google Sheet, edit `SHEET_ID` in `globals.py`
- The script automatically deletes and recreates each sheet before exporting
- To limit simultaneous exports (for lower-end PCs), you can add a concurrency cap in `main()`
